	<p style="font-size: 17px; font-family: courier"><a href=“https://www.art.yale.edu”>Yale School of Art's</a> design is one I would not expect. Each element has different colors that is not <span class="bborder"> aesthetically pleasing</span> together, but it separates each element with its function in mind.<span class="monospace" style="color: #d45a15; font-size: 10px"> Yale School of Art inspired me to separate elements with different colors and spacing.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="slant" style="color: #8008c4; font-size: 14px"> <a href=“https://tilde.town”>Tilde.town</a> uses two vital colors, purple and black. They utilized ASCII art as the focal point and it inspired me to look into <span class="vertical" style="font-size: 20px"> ASCII art</span>and include it in my design. I appreciate how they filled in unused parts of the website with a character and create contrast using space rather than color. The title is a unique touch as it is made out of symbols rather than actual letters.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 25px; color: #fff0bf; margin-inline: 20px;">Contrast is <span class="fontsmaller">extremely</span> important in <b>enabling users to differentiate between elements.</b> It helps organize and establish a hierarchy of importance that allows the user to efficiently navigate the design. <span class="fontsmaller">My goal was to create multiple focal points and establish visual interests that users will be unable to distinguish which elements are vital and which ones are secondary.</span> I made vital elements seem like a secondary element by manipulating size and overloaded the user with color contrast and made certain elements not stand out on the background. <p>

	<p style="transform: rotate(-2deg); border:2px inset red; font-family: Tourney; color: black"> Designs that have balanced color contrast is pleasing to the eye of the user and allows them to read information clearly. <b>The difference</b> in light between the foreground and it backgrounds makes elements stand out. </p>
		<p style="transform: rotate(-4deg); border: 4px double purple; font-family: Courier, Monaco, monospace; color: purple; margin-inline: 90px; background-color: beige;">Designs with multiple contrasting colors and fonts is <b>overwhelming</b> to look at and creates <I>inconsistency in an hierarchy of importance</I>. It can be distracting for <span style="color:brown"> users and prevent users from understand how to navigate a design. </span> But, depending on how colors are used, multiple key colors can serve as a way to navigate elements that perform different functions and <b>create a unique look.</b></p>
